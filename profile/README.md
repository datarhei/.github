## Publication services
**With datarhei Restreamer, you can stream everywhere at once!** The different publication services send live video output to a remote station. It is a virtual broadcast to deliver a live video to many or single destinations. The number of possible live video outputs is not limited.

## Audio 
**Full audio support for every video channel.** Decode more than 30 audio formats and encode them as well. Use the audio track of your input stream, remove it or use another. For example, add silence, convert it to AAC or MP3, or use your Icecast Server as an audio source.

## GPU encoding
**Use other input streams than H.264 and encode them to H.264 for best compatibility.** By encoding the videos, you can use different video sources such as H.265, VP8, and VP9. Encoding enhances an H.264 video or increases compatibility. Re-encode a video stream already encoded in H.264 and adjust the bitrate or frame rate without burdening the CPU. The freed processor time is therefore available for other tasks in the CPU.

## HDMI output
**Restreamer supports HDMI-OUT** and can output network video as HDMI signal. 

## Server and process logging
**Log files help analyze errors,** monitor proper operation or improve systems. In addition, log files obtain information about the video processing of FFmpeg. The data can adapt and optimize the video stream.

## Tons of useful functions
**The Restreamer contains many neat parts** that make everyday streaming easier and significantly expand the application possibilities of the program.

## Why use the datarhei Core
### datarhei Core is a management for FFmpeg processes without development effort. 
**The software is open-source and the central interface for mapping AV processes.**  datarhei Core is responsible for the design and management and provides all necessary interfaces to access the video content. The included control for FFmpeg can keep all used processes reliable and executable without the need for software developers to take care of it. In addition, process and resource limitation for all FFmpeg processes protects the host system from application overload. The overall system gives direct access to current process values (CPU, RAM) and complete control of system resources and load with statistical access to process data and current and historical logs.
